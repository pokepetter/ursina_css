# Ursina CSS

Ursina CSS extends your game possibilities by allowing your game to run in the user's browser, to extend game compatibilty.

When creating your game add the ``ursina`` and the ``Brython-<version>`` folders and the ``.nojekyll``, ``index.html`` and ``start_server.bat`` files in your root directory.
You can then simply code your game as a standard game and then open ``start_server.bat`` (*Windows*) or open your terminal, navigate to your game directory and run ``python3 -m http.server <port>``.
If you do not specify the port, it will be by default 8000.
You then just need to open your browser to ``localhost:<port>`` and enjoy.
